# Floats-and-Positioning---SASS-and-BEM
Original challenge issued by <a href="https://github.com/csun-metalab/awesome-metalab" target="blank">META+LAB</a> to be done before being considered into their summer internship program in 2017. 
Original challenge was required plain HTML and CSS. 
I re-explored this challenge on my own time to practice implementing SASS and practice the BEM naming conventions. 

## Objective
The objective for the project is to implement this image of colored squares into plain HTML and CSS:
![An array of different colored squares of different sizes meshed together into a rectangle](floatsAndPositioning.png)

* _Note that this personal project was done simply to practice SASS and BEM._
